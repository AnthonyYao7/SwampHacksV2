# NutriScanner
We wanted to create a product that promoted healthy eating habits. What better way to do that than know what nutrients are in your food, no matter what you're eatiing? NutriScanner allows you to upload pictures of your food and get a close estimate of the macros(calories, carbohydrates, protein, etc.) in your meal. It makes macro counting that much easier!

## Tools we used
This website was made built with raw JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend and a Python Flask backend to manage file uploads and interfacing with the convolutional neural network. We preprocessed the image data with NumPy and built our deep learning model with TensorFlow and Keras.
